# Zen Litter Box

## Description

This is a portfolio / blog / fun site I made with Next.js, and Firebase. Feel free to fork this and create your own zen litter box.

## Notes to Run

Inside ```utils/db/index``` you will need to provide your own ```.env``` file with the appropriate variables to connect to your Firebase instance.
